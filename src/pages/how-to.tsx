          Stamps are created in game and generate a file that can then be shared
          with others.

          Stamps are grouped in folders. Clicking on the stamp folder in the
          stamp menu will display a menu above it with a list of stamps in that
          folder. Right clicking the stamp or the stamp folder will display a
          menu allowing you to rename the folder/stamp and set an icon.

          will need to place the stamp file in the relevant region folder.
          Stamps can also be further sub categorized inside the region folder
          with a folder containing multiple stamps.
